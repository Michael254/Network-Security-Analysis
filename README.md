Network Security Analyzer is a small project created to automate the information gathering phase during the OSCP labs. Since a friend recommended me to not use automated vulnerability analyzers during the labs, because in the exams are not allowed, I thought it would be a good idea to combine common tools to make moore easier this process.

Also I will use this project to practice with programming asynchronous tasks, using the python library Celery and the message broker Redis. My general idea is to use every tool that it can be used in a regular Kali as a asyncronous module for the program.
